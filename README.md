# Up Next

See and join your meetings from the menu bar. Connects with your calendar and works with Zoom, Google Meet, Cisco Webex, and more. All supported platforms are [listed here](https://github.com/ellenli/upnext/issues/51) (with more to come).

Up Next is in active development. Built for macOS 10.12+. **Get the latest version from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/up-next/id1355117041?ls=1&mt=12).** :v:

## Setup

1. Run Up Next
2. The app will prompt for your Calendar data. This is required for Up Next to work! Click `OK`
3. Click `No upcoming meetings` (in your menu bar) > `Preferences...` and select your calendar from the calendar list to load your meetings

If the access prompt did not appear, or if you mis-clicked, you can fix this in `System Preferences` > `Security & Privacy` > `Calendars`. Make sure `Up Next` is checked in the list of apps that can access your Calendar data.

## Help

  <summary><b>I don't see my preferred calendar in the calendar list</b></summary><br />
Up Next uses data from the Calendar app. If your preferred calendar is missing from available calendars in Up Next, add your calendar to the Calendar app.

1. Run Calendar â€“ all available calendars are listed in the left `Calendars` sidebar. If your preferred calendar is missing from this list, go to step 2
2. `Calendar` > `Add account`
3. Complete the steps for your calendar account provider

If your calendar is still not showing up in Calendar, make sure your calendar account is enabled: `Calendar` > `Preferences...` > `Accounts` tab > Select your calendar account and make sure `Enable this account` is checked.
